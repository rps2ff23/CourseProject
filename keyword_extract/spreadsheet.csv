Gretchen Adams,"Gretchen is the best Chem teacher ever created. I hated Chem in HS, but when she taught me i actually started to love it! I hate myself for loving but goddamn its my guilty pleasure.

Scott Ahlgren,"By far one of the best professors I had at U of I. I went into this class with 0 background on calc. I walked out with a B. That B was because of his great teaching, humorful attitude, and clarity in explanations. If you put the time in, he puts the time in. Take it as a discovery course is he still teaches. You get your tuition worth with Prof A.",5.0

Iftikhar Ahmed,"I have taken business calculus twice. The first time was with murphy. The grading criteria for the class was just quizzes and test.

Worth taking with Ahmed",4.0
Iftikhar Ahmed,"We had a small scale class- about 20 students, so he really got to know us personally.

I would recommend you take his class.",5.0
Abdussalam Alawini,"Prof. Alawini definitely knows how to run a course. The course is extremely organized and he continuously takes feedback even during the middle of the semester.

Todd Allee,"All around unimpressive. Course material is a very basic introduction to International Relations, nothing complex. If you're into IR, it won't be anything new.

Stephen Altaner,"Honestly there was no reason for me to take this class, but I am so glad I did.

The class is not hard, attendance is fairly important because of the pop quizzes.  Can't recommend him and this class enough",5.0
Stephen Altaner,"Super easy class. As long as you keep up with the course notes, it's and easy A. Although attendance is not mandatory, there are 3 pop quizzes throughout the semester. However they are only worth 6% of the grade, and there is one extra credit assignment worth 5% bonus, so missing quizzes won't cost you much. I highly recommend this class.",4.5
Stephen Altaner,"Literally, everything in this class is simple if you attend lecture. However, the only part, and I mean ONLY PART you should be concerned about is the Collaborative Peer Review assignment. DO NOT ASK HIM TO REVIEW YOUR ESSAY.

Stephen Altaner,"If you take this class and don't get an A you should seriously consider dropping out of the university. The class is practically set up to give you a passing grade.

Stephen Altaner,"Easy as pie. Good class, interesting stuff... but remember he IS a geology professor; good luck with the rock talks. Never used the textbook, only the class notes and a CD that comes with the book. He's a funny guy, tells great jokes.  I really enjoyed this class.",5.0

Stephen Altaner,"Personally, I thought his incorporation of dry humor and Farside comics were great. I know people who thopught he was boring and not funny whatsoever, but I disagree. I can see how one can find him to be boring though. It just depends, I guess. GEOL-100 is an easy A anyways. Take notes in lecture, no need for the textbook (although it can help).",5.0

The tests were basically exactly like the practice tests, thank god. If I had the other teacher, I wouldn't have passed this class.",5.0
Jason Anema,"Jason was the best teacher! I thought the class was pretty easy, some of my friends struggled, but that's because the material can be tough if you aren't good at math.  Jason is amazing at explaining the problems! The midterms and tests were very similar to the homework and practice tests he gave us.",5.0

At some times it can be fun (catching fish in a river and working in forests/fields) but it's sooo much work. Probably the hardest class I've taken so far. Good luck with it...,4.5
Carol Augspurger,"Don't get me wrong, this class can be very challenging if you don't stay on-top of the work load. With that said, the class is really rewarding and I felt I learned a lot.  You can't ask for a better professor who  cares more about her students (after all she is in charge of the IB Undergrad Curriculum).",5.0
Carol Augspurger,"Simply amazing professor. She knows everyone's name, is completely fascinating. Challenging and time consuming course, but nonetheless wonderful.",4.5
Carol Augspurger,Her classes were the staple of my college career.  Never a more caring and awesome professor at UIUC!  She absolutely loves what she does and it shows.,5.0
Carol Augspurger,She was such a sweet lady and really cared about how her kids did in her class!  She can be a little intimidating calling on people randomly in class but the questions she asks aren't hard.  Her tests are all written so that was a little hard but she definitely knows what she's talking about and she seemed to to put a lot of effort into teaching.,4.5
