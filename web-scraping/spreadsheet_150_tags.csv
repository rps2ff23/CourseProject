Steven Hall,"For ADV 150, Professor Hall is a great professor and always has his own stories for everything. His lectures are not boring and the first day said all slides will have less than a sentence. He wants you to pass and will give TONS of extra credit.

Steven Hall,"His lectures are very engaging and interesting but make sure you take detailed notes because even small things will end up on tests.

James Hansen,"Professor Hansen is one of my favorite professors of all time. He's brilliant, incredibly engaging, and very funny. I always looked forward to his lectures.

James Hansen,Professor Hansen is the best professor I have had at the University. He made me think about things  I never had and gives you a new worthwhile perspective.
